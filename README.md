## Usage

This project use ES6 syntaxis and async/ await pattern with axios to call the API.

```shell
    ...
    # API call
    const getData = async() => {
        setCallError(false)
        try {
        const answer = await axios.get(API_URL);
        const result = answer.data.data
        # Extract the data in variables with map function...
        }catch(error){
        setCallError(true)
        alert('Is something wrong with API call')
        }
    }   
```   

## Stack 

Willing to keep practicing React and trying new libraries combination, I have chosen to build this challenge with:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Hooks)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
* [react-axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios)
* [validator](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)
* [Countries & Cities API](shorturl.at/iqM07)

## API/Component

The folder structure is divided in assets, components and hooks, with a custom hook for responsiveness using conditional rendering -credits to this [source](https://blog.logrocket.com/developing-responsive-layouts-with-react-hooks/). Conditional classNames have been used as well.

Components are imported to App.js except Button, which is reused twice in PayForm component. 
The logic is placed in App component and passed to child components through props. Semantic HTML tags and aria-label attributes have been applied when necessary.
The list of countries and codes is called from useEffect hook and form validation is coded with vanilla JS, regular expressions and validator.js library inside arrow functions.
